                            Network users demand excellent reception and performance 
                            wherever they go. Being connected at all times is key. To meet 
                            these demands, network operators need to constantly stay ahead 
                            of the technology curve, and all parts of thenetwork must 
                            function properly.

                        <p>
                            The R&S®PR100 is a portable receiver for “catching” interfering 
                            signals that are not obvious in the spectrum because of their 
                            pulsed, hopping or unstable timing behavior. Interference signals 
                            negatively impact radio networks. In some scenarios they will 
                            drastically reduce the data rate or significantly increase the 
                            number of dropped calls. Its realtime properties enable the 
                            R&S®PR100 to easily identify these unknown signals over a very wide 
                            bandwidth. The receiver’s compact design, low weight and battery 
                            operation, together with the  ̧HE 300 handheld directional antenna, 
                            make it ideal for field operation wherever needed.

                        <p>
                            Sources of interference must be located quickly since they 
                            limit or even block radiocommunications services. The fastest 
                            and easiest way to locate interference is homing with mobile 
                            direction finders (DF). The new R&S®DDF 007 portable direction 
                            finder turns a standard vehicle into a mobile DF within minutes. 
                            The compact R&S®ADD 107 (VHF/UHF) and R&S®ADD 207 (UHF/SHF) DF 
                            antennas with integrated GPS modules are quickly installed on 
                            the vehicle roof using a magnetic mount adapter.
